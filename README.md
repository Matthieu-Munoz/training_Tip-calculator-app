## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) for this challenge !

## The challenge

This is my take on this challenge.
It was quite challenging. I had never used nor styled form element. Moreso, the javascript was a complete first.
I can't believe how far i've come, after every submission of challenge I go throught each and every property to see what is really useful or if it's just something i've added that is, in the end, useless. There was always quite e lot of those, but for some reason, on the challenge, the was not that many !
I think I might be improving and I'm really happy about that.

## I'm not perfect

I'm a beginner, so I might not have all the best practice and, yes, still learning AND improving :blush:

## Feedbacks are welcome ! ðŸš€

Feel free to give me any feedback, they're always welcome.
